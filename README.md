# STUMPED

SUMMARY


Originally conceived for the 48h GMTK Jam 2021 with the theme "Joined Together", Stumped is a cute puzzle-platformer inspired by Disney's Fantasia - The Sorcerer's Apprentice.


- Move using WASD, the arrows or the left analog stick.
- Jump using W or Up.
- Press Space or the controller's south button to tether yourself to a vehicle.
- Vehicles include: rock, mushroom, dandelion, hat, broom, cauldron.


This was, for many of us, the first time working in a team for a game jam. We unfortunately did not succeed to finish the game in time due to severe overscoping. 


I put the current version of the game together as a way of salvaging the hard  work done by the other team members. Even though it feels a bit disjointed and slow, it was an incredible learning experience and I'm glad to have the game as a keepsake for this cute, charming idea.



STORY


Being a witch does not unfortunately take care of house chores and nobody has more than the young witch at the edge of the swamp. One morning she decides that enough is enough: she's a witch! Why would she have to do chores when she knows magic? Gathering all her knowledge of runes and enchantments, she creates a magical stump to do her bidding. Unfortunately, the stump has no regard for her orders and refuses to do the chores appropriately. The stump quickly steals the witch's hat, broom and cauldron (they might be useful after all) and goes off to find their own home somewhere in the swamp.
